I have now changed my portfolio to react to make it more interactive, responsive and loading much faster. All the SCSS was removed but can still be seen on github https://github.com/boneswvb/portfolio. For this portfolio I used minimal CSS to see how little I can get away with.

You can also see my gists on https://gist.github.com/boneswvb for some JavaScript projects that I worked on during my training.

My first portfolio can be viewed at https://github.com/boneswvb/firstPortfolio
