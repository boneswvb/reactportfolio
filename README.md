I have now changed my portfolio to react to make it more interactive, responsive and loading much faster. All the SCSS was removed but can still be seen on github https://github.com/boneswvb/portfolio. For this portfolio I used minimal CSS to see how little I can get away with.

You can also see my gists on https://gist.github.com/boneswvb for some JavaScript projects that I worked on during my training.

My first portfolio can be viewed at https://github.com/boneswvb/firstPortfolio

There is still some links that is not working properly and some headings that need some attention but at this stage will have to wait until I'm done with the data base training. I will update this when adding the data base to load on Lesawi.co.za as a final product.
